## Introduction
This is my first game made in C++. I made it in about 2 weeeks. Some bugs in this game i haven't fixed @@. I hope you enjoy with it. 
This is also my project for Advance Programing Subject.  

Only dependencies are the **SDL2**, **SDL2-image**, **SDL2 ttf** and **SDL2 mixer** libraries.

All code was written by me.

## Build pre-requisites

Install C++, [Mingw64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/8.1.0/threads-win32/seh/x86_64-8.1.0-release-win32-seh-rt_v6-rev0.7z/download).

**Install MakeFile, SDL2, SDL2-image, SDL2 ttf and SDL2 mixer.**

FreeBSD:

    $ pkg install make sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer sdl2_ttf

    $ brew install make sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer sdl2_ttf 


# Building and running
